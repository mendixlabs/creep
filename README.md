creep
=====

XMPP-based chatbot that's easy to extend. Originally inspired by <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gozerbot">gozerbot</a>. Easy & minimal plugin structure, couple of useful plugins out-of-the-box:
 - http-json: provides HTTP interface that lets you POST messages to a XMPP conference rooms
 - quotes: add & ask about quotes
 - dns-resolver: resolve domains from within the bot. Useful for situations where your bot is running behind your firewall but you want to quickly resolve a host on that local network
